I am an iOS developer responsible for the development and maintenance of applications aimed at a range of iOS devices including mobile phones and tablet computers. Mainly I work in the development of iOS applications as a front-end developer, and I do some of their integration with back-end services. I have experience working alongside other engineers and developers where we work on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, I have developed a good sense of commitment to collaborative problem solving. I enjoy sophisticated design, and the creation of quality products.
