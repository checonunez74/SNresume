Hi! My name is Sergio Nunez. I am a Software Developer, and I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work. With 20 years experience as a professional graphic designer/web developer, I have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to make your project a success. I enjoy every step of the design process, from discussion and collaboration to concept and execution, but I find the most satisfaction in seeing the finished product do everything for you that it was created to do.
